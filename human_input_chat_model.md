Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.\n\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).\n\nThe only values that should be in the \"action\" field are: Wikipedia\n\nThe $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nALWAYS use the following format:\n\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: the result of the action\n...
